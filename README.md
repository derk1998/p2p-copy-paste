# P2P Copy Paste

I keep getting into situations where I need to transfer something, for instance a link, between devices. Either I gather enough patience to manually type it over or send a mail to myself. This should be easier and that's where this project comes in.

## Some notes about the implementation

This is also sort of an experiment for me as this is my first Flutter app. When I was following tutorials I found that people barely spend time on layering. And since I'm fan of MVVM and clean architecture I decided to incorporate it in this project as well.

It is also my first project using WebRTC so it's all very exciting.
